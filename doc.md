## Task: Build a To-Do List API

### Requirements:

1. **Language:** Choose a backend programming language you're comfortable with (e.g., Python, Node.js, Ruby).

2. **Framework:** Use a web framework to simplify the development process (e.g., Flask for Python, Express for Node.js).

3. **Database:** Implement a simple database to store tasks (e.g., SQLite for simplicity).

4. **API Endpoints:**
   - Create a task
   - Retrieve all tasks
   - Retrieve a specific task
   - Update a task
   - Delete a task

5. **Data Model:** Define a simple data model for tasks (e.g., task ID, title, description, completion status).

6. **Validation:** Implement basic validation for input data (e.g., ensure the task title is not empty).

7. **Documentation:** Create a simple API documentation (can be in the form of a README file).

8. **Testing:** Write basic tests for your API endpoints.

### Optional Enhancements:

1. **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to allow users to have their own to-do lists.

2. **Due Dates:** Include due dates for tasks.

3. **Categories/Tags:** Allow users to categorize tasks.

4. **Priority Levels:** Implement priority levels for tasks.

5. **Web Interface:** Create a basic web interface (front end) to interact with your API.

### Tips:

- Break down the project into smaller tasks and focus on one task at a time.
- Utilize online resources, tutorials, and documentation to learn as you go.
- Make use of version control (e.g., Git) to track your progress.

This challenge will give you hands-on experience in building a simple backend system, interacting with a database, and creating a RESTful API. As you progress, you can enhance the project by adding more features and complexity. Remember, the goal is to learn and improve, so don't hesitate to explore new concepts and seek help when needed. Good luck!
